        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to simulate in a really simple way the entire football season including the playoffs.</p>
        <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
        <P>I want to focus on optimizing the way my code works,  object-oriented programming practice, and just having as much fun as possible!</P>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Simulate football season of <b>n</b> teams.</li>
            <li>
                Teams will play in a round-robin tournament system. Where 4 teams with most points will play in the play-off in a single-elimination (knockout) system.
                <br>
                The total number of games would be <b><i>G</i></b> = (<b>n</b>*(<b>n</b>-1))/2 + <b>N</b> - 1 where <b>N</b> is the number of playoff teams.
            </li>
            <li>For winning a game team will get <b>3</b> points, the tie would give <b>1</b> point, and there are <b>no points</b> for losing a game!</li>
            <li>
                Each team must have:
                <ul class="sublist">
                    <li>Name (doesn't need to be unique, but should be).</li>
                    <li>Unique ID.</li>
                    <li>Skill Points - randomly generated.</li>
                    <li>Win Counter</li>
                    <li>Lose Counter</li>
                    <li>League Points - Amount of points gathered in this season.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Games - each team will have a chance of scoring every 10 minutes of the game (9 attempts to simplify).
                Chance would be equal to <b>X = (<i>team skill points</i>/5)/100*100%</b>, for an example: 
                <br>
                A team with 90 skill points will have an 18% chance to score on each attempt.
            </li>
            <li>Results of game:  
                <ul class="sublist">
                    <li>The Losers team will lose 1 skill point and will get no points as stated above.</li>
                    <li>The Winner's team will gain 1 skill point and will get 3 League Points.</li>
                    <li>In case of a tie, no teams will lose their skill points and they will gain 1 League Point.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
