        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to simulate in a really simple way the entire football season.</p>
        <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
        <P>I want to focus on optimizing the way my code works,  object-oriented programming practice, and just having as much fun as possible!</P>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Simulate football season of <b>n</b> teams where <b>n</b> &gt;= 4.</li>
            <li>
                Teams will play in a round-robin tournament system.
                <br>
                The total number of games would be <b><i>G</i></b> = (<b>n</b>*(<b>n</b>-1))/2.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each team must have:
                <ul class="sublist">
                    <li>Name (doesn't need to be unique, but should be).</li>
                    <li>Unique ID.</li>
                    <li>Skill Points - randomly generated.</li>
                    <li>Win Counter</li>
                    <li>Lose Counter</li>
                    <li>Draw Counter</li>
                    <li>League Points - Amount of points gathered in this season.</li>
                    <li>Scored Goals</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Games - each team will have a chance of scoring every <b>GameTurns</b> attempts where <b><br>GameTurns = rand(1,<i>(Team1Skill(with more points) - Team1Skill(with less points))%10</i>)</b><br>or in case if teams skill points are equal <b>GameTurns = rand(1,10)</b>. Game would look like:<br>
                <pre>for GameTurns 
    temp1 = Team1Skill
    temp2 = Team2Skill
    while temp1&gt;=0 and temp2&gt;=0
        temp1 -= random from 1 to 5;
        temp2 -= random from 1 to 5;
    if temp1&lt;=0 and temp2&lt;=0
        no goals
    if temp1&lt;temp2
        team1 scores
    else 
        team2 scores
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>Results of game:  
                <ul class="sublist">
                    <li>For winning a game team will get <b>3</b> points, the tie would give <b>1</b> point, and there are <b>no points</b> for losing a game!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
