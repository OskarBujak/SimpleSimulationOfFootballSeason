        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to simulate in a really simple way the entire football season including the playoffs.</p>
        <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
        <P>I want to focus on optimizing the way my code works,  object-oriented programming practice, and just having as much fun as possible!</P>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Simulate football season of <b>n</b> teams.</li>
            <li>Teams will play in a round-robin tournament system. Where 4 teams with most points will play in the play-off in a single-elimination (knockout) system.
                <br>
                The total number of games would be <b><i>G</i></b> = (<b>n</b>*(<b>n</b>-1))/2 + <b>N</b> - 1 where <b>N</b> is the number of playoff teams.
            </li>
            <li>For winning a game team will get <i>3</i> points, the tie would give 1 point, and there are no points for losing a game!</li>
            <li>
                Each team must have:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li class="sublist">Name (doesn't need to be unique, but should be).</li>
                    <li>Unique ID.</li>
                    <li>Amount of points gathered in this season.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
